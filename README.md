<h2 align="leftr">Description</h2>
<p align="leftr">The textures for the game were taken from open sources. There is also a video on YouTube with the implementation of this game, but the code in it was quite primitive. I completely rewrote the code, making it scalable, added dependency injection via Zenject, integrated advertising and the payment system. I also configured the ability to update enemy parameters via Google Tables.</p>
